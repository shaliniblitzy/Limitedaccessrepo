## 1.2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### 1.2.1 Project Context

#### Business Context and Market Positioning

Node.js 22 will enter long-term support (LTS) in October, but until then, it will be the "Current" release for the next six months. Also of note is that Node.js 18 will go End-of-Life in April 2025, so we advise you to start planning to upgrade to Node.js 20 (LTS) or Node.js 22 (soon to be LTS). The tutorial project leverages the latest stable Node.js runtime environment to ensure compatibility with current development practices and security standards.

#### Current System Limitations

Traditional learning approaches often lack practical, executable examples that demonstrate real-world server implementation. Many existing tutorials focus on complex frameworks without establishing fundamental HTTP server concepts, creating knowledge gaps for new developers.

# 3. TECHNOLOGY STACK

## 3.1 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

### 3.1.1 Primary Language Selection

| Component | Language | Version | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Server Runtime** | JavaScript (Node.js) | Node.js 22.x LTS (Active until October 2025, Maintenance until April 2027) | Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases |

### 3.1.2 Language Selection Criteria

**JavaScript Selection Rationale**
- **Project Requirement Alignment**: The tutorial project specifically requires Node.js implementation for educational purposes
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.jsÂ® is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts
- **Educational Value**: Provides clear demonstration of server-side JavaScript concepts without additional language complexity
- **Built-in HTTP Support**: Node.js has a fantastic standard library, including first-class support for networking

### 3.1.3 Version Constraints and Dependencies

**Node.js Version Requirements**
- **Current LTS Status**: Node.js v22.x is an excellent choice for those aiming for long-term support in production environments with Active LTS support extending into late 2025
- **Compatibility Requirements**: You should be running a currently supported version of Node.js to run npm. For a list of which versions of Node.js are currently supported, please see the Node.js releases page
- **Security Considerations**: New security releases to be made available Tuesday, July 15, 2025

## 3.2 FRAMEWORKS & LIBRARIES

### 3.2.1 Core Framework Selection

| Framework Category | Selection | Version | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HTTP Server Framework** | Node.js Built-in HTTP Module | Native (Node.js 22.x) | Educational focus on fundamentals without external dependencies |
| **Module System** | ES Modules (ESM) | Native (Node.js 22.x) | ES Modules (ESM) have become the clear winner, offering better tooling support and alignment with web standards |

### 3.2.2 Framework Justification

**Native HTTP Module Selection**
- **Educational Purpose**: The Node.js HTTP API is very low-level. It deals with stream handling and message parsing only
- **Zero Dependencies**: Eliminates external framework complexity for tutorial clarity
- **Protocol Compliance**: The HTTP interfaces in Node.js are designed to support many features of the protocol which have been traditionally difficult to use. In particular, large, possibly chunk-encoded, messages. The interface is careful to never buffer entire requests or responses
- **Performance**: A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking

**ES Modules Adoption**
- **Modern Standards**: Modern Node.js development embraces ES Modules with a crucial additionâthe node: prefix for built-in modules. This explicit naming prevents confusion and makes dependencies crystal clear
- **Import Syntax**: This module, containing both a client and server, can be imported via require('node:http') (CommonJS) or import * as http from 'node:http' (ES module)

### 3.2.3 Compatibility Requirements

**Module System Compatibility**
- **Backward Compatibility**: The beauty of modern Node.js lies in its evolution while maintaining backward compatibility. You can adopt these patterns incrementally, and they work alongside existing code
- **Import Standards**: Built-in modules can be identified using the node: prefix, in which case it bypasses the require cache. For instance, require('node:http') will always return the built in HTTP module

## 3.3 OPEN SOURCE DEPENDENCIES

### 3.3.1 Core Dependencies

| Dependency Type | Package | Version | Registry | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Runtime Environment** | Node.js | 22.x LTS | Official Node.js | JavaScript runtime and HTTP module |
| **Package Manager** | npm | 11.4.2 (latest) | npm Registry | Dependency management (bundled with Node.js) |

### 3.3.2 Dependency Justification

**Zero External Dependencies Approach**
- **Educational Focus**: Tutorial project emphasizes understanding Node.js fundamentals without external library abstractions
- **Minimal Complexity**: Node.js HTTP module is a built-in library that allows developers to create web servers, as well as communicate with other APIs using HTTP 1.1, HTTP 2, and HTTPS
- **Built-in Capabilities**: The built-in modules are defined within the Node.js source and are located in the lib/ folder. Built-in modules can be identified using the node: prefix

**Package Manager Selection**
- **Default Integration**: npm comes bundled with node, & most third-party distributions, by default. npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js
- **Registry Access**: Over 3.1 million packages are available in the main npm registry. The free npm Registry has become the center of JavaScript code sharing, and with more than two million packages, the largest software registry in the world

### 3.3.3 Package Registry Configuration

**npm Registry Details**
- **Primary Registry**: It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website
- **Version Management**: npm also manages versioning, so you can specify any specific version of a package, or require a version higher or lower than what you need. npm follows the semantic versioning (semver) standard

## 3.4 THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The function that's passed in to createServer is called once for every HTTP request that's made against that server, so it's called the request handler. The core business process centers around the HTTP request-response cycle that handles client requests and generates appropriate responses.

```mermaid

    B --> C{Parse Request URL and Method}
    C --> D{Route Validation}
    D -->|Path = '/hello' AND Method = GET| E[Execute Hello Handler]
    D -->|Path â  '/hello' OR Method â  GET| F[Execute 404 Handler]
    
    E --> G[Generate Hello World Response]
    G --> H[Set Response Headers]

    F --> K[Generate 404 Error Response]
    K --> L[Set Error Headers]
    L --> M[Set Status Code 404]
    M --> N[Send Error Response to Client]
    
    J --> O[Log Request Completion]
    N --> O
    O --> P[End Request Cycle]
    
    Q[Request Timeout] -.-> R[Cleanup Resources]
    B -.-> Q
    R -.-> P
```

    P -->|No| O
    P -->|Yes| Q[Graceful Shutdown]
    Q --> R[Close Server]
    R --> S[Exit Process]
```

### 4.1.2 Integration Workflows

#### Request-Response Data Flow

Remember, the request object is a ReadableStream and the response object is a WritableStream. That means we can use pipe to direct data from one to the other.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as HTTP Client
    participant Server as Node.js Server
    participant Handler as Request Handler
    participant Response as Response Generator
    
    Client->>Server: HTTP GET /hello
    Note over Server: Parse incoming request
    Server->>Handler: Route to appropriate handler
    
    alt Path matches '/hello'
        Handler->>Response: Generate success response
        Response->>Response: Set Content-Type: text/plain
        Response->>Response: Set Status: 200
        Response->>Server: "Hello world" message
    else Path does not match
        Handler->>Response: Generate error response
        Response->>Response: Set Status: 404
        Response->>Server: "Not Found" message
    end
    
    Server->>Client: HTTP Response
    Note over Client: Process response
```

#### Error Handling Integration Flow

An error in the request stream presents itself by emitting an 'error' event on the stream. If you don't have a listener for that event, the error will be thrown, which could crash your Node.js program. You should therefore add an 'error' listener on your request streams, even if you just log it and continue on your way.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Request Processing] --> B{Error Occurred?}
    B -->|No| C[Normal Processing]
    B -->|Yes| D{Error Type}
    
    D -->|Request Stream Error| E[Log Error to Console]
    D -->|Route Not Found| F[Generate 404 Response]
    D -->|Server Error| G[Generate 500 Response]
    
    E --> H[Continue Processing]
    F --> I[Send Error Response]
    G --> I
    
    C --> J[Generate Success Response]
    J --> K[Send Response]
    I --> L[Log Error Details]
    K --> M[Request Complete]
    L --> M
    
    H --> N{Can Recover?}
    N -->|Yes| C
    N -->|No| O[Terminate Request]

### 4.3.2 Error Handling Implementation

#### Comprehensive Error Handling Flow

In Express, 404 responses are not the result of an error, so the error-handler middleware will not capture them. This behavior is because a 404 response simply indicates the absence of additional work to do; in other words, Express has executed all middleware functions

```mermaid

### 4.4.3 Concurrent Request Handling

This is how NodeJS manages high throughput despite having only a single thread: If you use asynchronous I/O throughout, your actual code doesn't have to occupy the thread for all that long, because it doesn't wait for the I/O to complete. It can do more work on other things while the I/O is pending, and then respond to it when the I/O completes.

# 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

## 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1.1 System Overview

The Node.js tutorial application follows a **minimalist single-threaded event-driven architecture** that demonstrates fundamental HTTP server concepts without external framework dependencies. Node.js employs a "Single Threaded Event Loop" design to manage several concurrent clients, making it ideal for educational purposes where understanding core concepts takes precedence over production complexity.

The architectural approach emphasizes **simplicity and educational clarity** by utilizing only Node.js built-in modules. The Node.js HTTP API is very low-level and deals with stream handling and message parsing only, providing direct exposure to fundamental web server mechanics without abstraction layers that could obscure learning objectives.

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Relies exclusively on Node.js built-in HTTP module to eliminate complexity
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Node.js Processing Model is based on the JavaScript event-based model along with the JavaScript callback mechanism
- **Non-Blocking I/O**: Node.js uses asynchronous, non-blocking I/O operations, which allows it to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking the execution thread
- **Educational Focus**: Architecture prioritizes learning outcomes over production scalability

**System Boundaries:**
The application operates within a constrained scope focusing on HTTP request-response cycles. The interface is careful to never buffer entire requests or responses, so the user is able to stream data. The system boundary encompasses HTTP protocol handling, basic routing logic, and response generation while explicitly excluding database integration, authentication, and complex business logic.

**Major Interfaces:**
- **HTTP Network Interface**: Standard TCP/IP socket communication on configurable port (default 3000)
- **Operating System Interface**: Integration with OS network stack for socket management
- **Node.js Runtime Interface**: Direct utilization of built-in HTTP module capabilities

### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Integration Points |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HTTP Server Instance** | Accept and manage incoming HTTP connections | Node.js HTTP module, OS network stack | Network interface, request router |
| **Request Router** | Parse URLs and route requests to appropriate handlers | HTTP server instance, URL parsing utilities | Handler functions, error processor |
| **Hello Handler** | Generate "Hello world" response for '/hello' endpoint | Request router, response generator | HTTP response interface |
| **Error Handler** | Process undefined routes and generate 404 responses | Request router, response generator | HTTP response interface |

### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

**Primary Request Processing Flow:**
The data flow follows a linear progression from HTTP request receipt through response delivery. When a new request is received, the request event is called, providing two objects: a request and a response. Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.

**Request Processing Pipeline:**
1. **HTTP Request Reception**: Server receives raw HTTP request data through TCP socket
2. **Request Object Creation**: Node.js HTTP module parses raw data into structured request object
3. **URL and Method Extraction**: Router component extracts URL path and HTTP method from request
4. **Route Matching**: Router determines appropriate handler based on URL path comparison
5. **Handler Execution**: Selected handler generates appropriate response content
6. **Response Object Population**: Handler sets HTTP status codes, headers, and body content
7. **Response Transmission**: Server sends formatted HTTP response back to client

**Data Transformation Points:**
- **Raw HTTP to Request Object**: Node.js HTTP module transforms incoming byte stream into structured JavaScript object
- **URL String to Route Parameters**: Router extracts and validates path components for matching
- **Handler Logic to HTTP Response**: Response generators transform application logic into HTTP-compliant format

**Integration Patterns:**
The system employs **synchronous request processing** with **asynchronous I/O operations**. When working with an HTTP module, you can listen and act upon the events, while the data is processed using streams. Both of these work in a non-blocking manner.

### 5.1.4 External Integration Points

| System Name | Integration Type | Data Exchange Pattern | Protocol/Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Operating System Network Stack** | System-level | Bidirectional socket communication | TCP/IP over HTTP/1.1 |
| **HTTP Clients** | Network-based | Request-response cycle | HTTP/1.1 with text/plain content |
| **Node.js Runtime** | Runtime-level | Module import and execution | JavaScript ES Module system |

## 5.2 COMPONENT DETAILS

### 5.2.1 HTTP Server Instance

**Purpose and Responsibilities:**
The HTTP Server Instance serves as the foundational component that creates and manages the web server infrastructure. The createServer() method of http creates a new HTTP server and returns it. The server is set to listen on the specified port and host name.

**Technologies and Frameworks:**
- **Core Technology**: Node.js v22.x with Active LTS support extending into late 2025
- **HTTP Implementation**: Node.js HTTP module is a built-in library that allows developers to create web servers, as well as communicate with other APIs using HTTP 1.1, HTTP 2, and HTTPS
- **Module System**: ES Modules (ESM) have become the clear winner, offering better tooling support and alignment with web standards

**Key Interfaces and APIs:**
- **Server Creation**: `http.createServer()` method for server instantiation
- **Port Binding**: `server.listen()` method for network interface binding
- **Event Handling**: Request event listeners for incoming HTTP requests
- **Connection Management**: Automatic handling of client connections and disconnections

**Data Persistence Requirements:**
No persistent data storage required. The server operates as a stateless component with all state maintained in memory during request processing cycles.

**Scaling Considerations:**
Event Loop processes all requests one at a time, therefore a single thread is sufficient. The entire process of serving requests consumes less memory and server resources since requests are handled one at a time.

### 5.2.2 Request Router

**Purpose and Responsibilities:**
The Request Router component analyzes incoming HTTP requests and determines the appropriate handler based on URL path matching. It serves as the central dispatch mechanism that enables the server to respond differently to various endpoints.

**Technologies and Frameworks:**
- **URL Parsing**: Node.js built-in URL utilities for path extraction
- **Pattern Matching**: Simple string comparison for exact path matching
- **Method Validation**: HTTP method verification for request type handling

**Key Interfaces and APIs:**
- **Request Analysis**: Extraction of URL path and HTTP method from request object
- **Route Matching**: Comparison logic for determining handler selection
- **Handler Dispatch**: Invocation of appropriate response generation functions

**Data Persistence Requirements:**
No persistent routing configuration. Route definitions are embedded in application logic as conditional statements.

**Scaling Considerations:**
Current implementation supports single endpoint routing. Future scaling would require route table implementation and pattern matching algorithms for multiple endpoints.

### 5.2.3 Hello Handler

**Purpose and Responsibilities:**
The Hello Handler generates the primary functional response for the '/hello' endpoint, delivering the "Hello world" message that fulfills the core business requirement.

**Technologies and Frameworks:**
- **Response Generation**: HTTP response object manipulation
- **Content-Type Management**: HTTP header configuration for plain text responses
- **Status Code Setting**: HTTP 200 status code assignment for successful responses

**Key Interfaces and APIs:**
- **Response Object Interface**: Direct manipulation of HTTP response properties
- **Header Management**: Setting Content-Type and other HTTP headers
- **Body Content Generation**: Static text message creation and delivery

**Data Persistence Requirements:**
Static response content with no database or file system dependencies.

**Scaling Considerations:**
Handler designed for static content delivery. Extension to dynamic content would require parameter processing and template rendering capabilities.

### 5.2.4 Error Handler

**Purpose and Responsibilities:**
The Error Handler manages requests to undefined routes by generating appropriate HTTP 404 responses, ensuring proper HTTP protocol compliance and user feedback.

**Technologies and Frameworks:**
- **Error Response Generation**: HTTP 404 status code and message creation
- **Protocol Compliance**: Standard HTTP error response formatting
- **Client Communication**: Clear error messaging for undefined endpoints

**Key Interfaces and APIs:**
- **Error Detection**: Recognition of unmatched route requests
- **Status Code Management**: HTTP 404 status assignment
- **Error Message Generation**: User-friendly error response creation

**Data Persistence Requirements:**
No persistent error logging or storage requirements in current implementation.

**Scaling Considerations:**
Basic error handling suitable for tutorial purposes. Production scaling would require comprehensive error logging, monitoring, and recovery mechanisms.

## 5.3 TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### 5.3.1 Architecture Style Decisions

**Event-Driven Architecture Selection:**
The decision to implement an event-driven architecture aligns with Node.js core strengths and educational objectives. Node js is based on a single-threaded event loop architecture which allows Node to handle multiple client requests. Node js uses the concept of an asynchronous model and non-blocking I/O.

| **Single-Threaded Model** | Simplifies concurrency concepts for learning | Limited CPU-intensive task handling |
| **Event Loop Processing** | Demonstrates Node.js fundamental architecture | Sequential request processing |
| **Built-in Module Usage** | Eliminates external dependencies | Reduced feature richness |

**Minimalist Design Pattern:**
The architectural approach prioritizes educational clarity over production features. Modern Node.js embraces web standards, reduces external dependencies, and provides a more intuitive developer experience.

**Justification Matrix:**

| Architectural Aspect | Decision | Alternative Considered | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Framework Usage** | No external frameworks | Express.js, Fastify | Educational focus on fundamentals |
| **Routing Strategy** | Simple conditional logic | Router libraries | Transparency of routing mechanics |
| **Error Handling** | Basic HTTP status codes | Comprehensive error middleware | Simplicity for tutorial scope |

### 5.3.2 Communication Pattern Choices

**Synchronous Request Processing:**
The application employs synchronous request processing within the event loop while maintaining asynchronous I/O capabilities. This design choice balances educational clarity with Node.js architectural principles.

**HTTP Protocol Implementation:**
The HTTP interfaces in Node.js are designed to support many features of the protocol which have been traditionally difficult to use. In particular, large, possibly chunk-encoded, messages. The interface is careful to never buffer entire requests or responses.

    B --> C[Extract HTTP Method]
    C --> D{Method === 'GET'?}
    D -->|No| E[Method Not Allowed Handler]
    D -->|Yes| F{Path === '/hello'?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Hello Handler]
    F -->|No| H[404 Not Found Handler]
    
    E --> I[405 Response]
    G --> J[200 Success Response]
    H --> K[404 Error Response]
```

**Component Interface:**

| Interface Method | Parameters | Return Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `parseRequest()` | HTTP request object | Request metadata | Extracts URL and method |
| `matchRoute()` | URL path, method | Handler function | Determines appropriate handler |
| `dispatchHandler()` | Handler, request, response | Void | Executes selected handler |

**Routing Performance:**
- **Path Matching**: O(1) constant time for exact string comparison

| **Error Logging** | Console output | Development debugging support |

### 6.1.4 Component Integration Architecture

**Inter-Component Communication:**
The system components communicate through a linear request processing pipeline that maintains separation of concerns while ensuring efficient data flow.

**Component Dependency Graph:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[HTTP Server Component] --> B[Request Router Component]
    B --> C[Hello Handler Component]
    B --> D[Error Handler Component]
    
    E[Node.js HTTP Module] --> A
    F[Operating System Network Stack] --> A
    
    C --> G[HTTP Response Interface]
    D --> G
    G --> H[Client Connection]
    
    I[Request Processing Pipeline] --> J[Response Generation Pipeline]
    J --> K[Network Transmission]
```

**Data Flow Architecture:**
The request object is a ReadableStream and behaves like an EventEmitter when an error happens, enabling event-driven processing throughout the component chain.

**Component State Management:**
All components operate in a stateless manner, with request-specific data passed through function parameters rather than maintained in component state. This approach ensures thread safety and simplifies debugging in the educational context.

## 6.2 DETAILED COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS

### 6.2.1 HTTP Server Component Specification

**Module Dependencies:**
- **Primary Dependency**: Node.js HTTP module imported via require('node:http') (CommonJS) or import * as http from 'node:http' (ES module)
- **System Dependencies**: Operating system TCP/IP stack for network communication
- **Runtime Dependencies**: Node.js 22 which will enter long-term support (LTS) in October

**Configuration Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `port` | Integer | 3000 | Network port for server binding |
| `hostname` | String | 'localhost' | Network interface binding address |
| `backlog` | Integer | 511 | Maximum pending connections queue |
| `keepAliveTimeout` | Integer | 5000ms | Connection keep-alive duration |

**Error Handling Mechanisms:**
An error in the request stream presents itself by emitting an 'error' event on the stream. If you don't have a listener for that event, the error will be thrown, which could crash your Node.js program. You should therefore add an 'error' listener on your request streams.

**Performance Monitoring:**
- **Connection Metrics**: Active connection count and connection rate
- **Request Metrics**: Request processing time and throughput
- **Error Metrics**: Error rate and error type classification
- **Resource Metrics**: Memory usage and CPU utilization

### 6.2.2 Request Router Component Specification

The router implements a simplified routing mechanism optimized for educational purposes, using direct string comparison rather than complex pattern matching algorithms.

**Route Definition Structure:**

| Route Pattern | HTTP Method | Handler Function | Response Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/hello` | GET | helloHandler | Success (200) |
| `*` (wildcard) | Any | errorHandler | Not Found (404) |

**Request Processing Pipeline:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as HTTP Client
    participant Server as HTTP Server
    participant Router as Request Router
    participant Handler as Response Handler
    
    Client->>Server: HTTP Request
    Server->>Router: Parse Request (URL, Method)
    Router->>Router: Validate HTTP Method
    Router->>Router: Match URL Path
    
    alt Path matches '/hello'
        Router->>Handler: Route to Hello Handler
        Handler->>Server: Generate Success Response
    else Path does not match
        Router->>Handler: Route to Error Handler
        Handler->>Server: Generate Error Response
    end
    
    Server->>Client: HTTP Response
```

**Validation Rules:**
- **URL Path Validation**: Exact string match for '/hello' endpoint
- **HTTP Method Validation**: Accept only GET requests for tutorial scope
- **Request Format Validation**: Basic HTTP request structure verification
- **Security Validation**: Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

```

**Error Recovery Mechanisms:**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing other requests after individual request errors
- **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure proper connection closure for error responses
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error information for debugging purposes

## 6.3 COMPONENT INTERACTION PATTERNS

### 6.3.1 Request Processing Flow

**Primary Processing Pipeline:**
The system implements a linear request processing pipeline that maintains clear separation between components while ensuring efficient data flow and error handling.

**Component Interaction Sequence:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[HTTP Request Arrives] --> B[Server Component Receives Request]
    B --> C[Create Request/Response Objects]
    C --> D[Router Component Analyzes Request]
    
    D --> E{Route Match Decision}
    E -->|Match Found| F[Hello Handler Execution]
    E -->|No Match| G[Error Handler Execution]

**Educational Value:**
The monitoring implementation demonstrates fundamental observability concepts while maintaining simplicity appropriate for tutorial learning objectives. From these basics, Node.js HTTP servers for many typical use cases can be constructed with plenty of other things these APIs provide.

# 6. SYSTEM COMPONENTS DESIGN

## 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

**Core Services Architecture is not applicable for this system.**

### 6.1.1 Architecture Rationale

The Node.js tutorial application implementing a single '/hello' endpoint does not require a microservices or distributed architecture approach. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking, making it ideally suited for simple, monolithic applications.

**Why Microservices Architecture is Not Appropriate:**

| Consideration | Tutorial Application | Microservices Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| **Functional Complexity** | Single endpoint with static response | Multiple business domains requiring separation |
| **Scalability Needs** | Educational/development use only | High-traffic production environments |
| **Team Structure** | Individual learning project | Multiple development teams |
| **Deployment Requirements** | Local development environment | Independent service deployment |

### 6.1.2 Monolithic Architecture Benefits

**Educational and Simplicity Advantages:**
The tutorial application benefits from a monolithic architecture that emphasizes learning fundamental concepts without the complexity overhead of distributed systems. Node.js has a fantastic standard library, including first-class support for networking, providing all necessary capabilities within a single process.

**Technical Justification:**
- **Zero External Dependencies**: This code first includes the Node.js http module. The createServer() method of http creates a new HTTP server and returns it
- **Single Process Efficiency**: There is no need to establish multiple threads because Event Loop processes all requests one at a time, therefore a single thread is sufficient. The entire process of serving requests to a Node.js server consumes less memory and server resources since the requests are handled one at a time
- **Educational Clarity**: Simple architecture allows focus on HTTP fundamentals without distributed system complexity

### 6.1.3 Alternative Architecture Considerations

**When Microservices Would Be Appropriate:**
Future evolution of this tutorial application might warrant microservices architecture under the following conditions:

| Scenario | Microservices Justification | Implementation Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Multi-Domain Tutorial** | Separate user management, content delivery, analytics | Microservices architecture structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business domain. These services are independently deployable and scalable, promoting agility and resilience |
| **Production Deployment** | High availability and independent scaling | Use load balancers to share tasks |
| **Team-Based Development** | Multiple developers working on different features | when a large team is involved in the project, then the application is easier to maintain as the microservices and their responsibilities can be shared between the developers |

### 6.1.4 Current Architecture Pattern

**Single-Service Monolithic Design:**
The tutorial application follows a simplified monolithic pattern optimized for educational purposes and development environments.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[HTTP Client Request] --> B[Node.js HTTP Server]
    B --> C[Request Router]
    C --> D{Route Analysis}
    D -->|/hello| E[Hello Handler]
    D -->|Other| F[404 Handler]
    E --> G[Success Response]
    F --> H[Error Response]
    G --> I[HTTP Client]
    H --> I
    
    J[Single Process Boundary] -.-> B
    J -.-> C
    J -.-> E
    J -.-> F
    
    K[No External Services] -.-> L[No Service Discovery]
    K -.-> M[No Load Balancing]
    K -.-> N[No Circuit Breakers]
```

### 6.1.5 Scalability Through Simplicity

**Educational Scalability Model:**
Rather than horizontal service scaling, the tutorial application demonstrates vertical scalability concepts within a single process:

| Scalability Aspect | Current Implementation | Educational Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Request Handling** | Event-driven single thread | Understanding Node.js concurrency model |
| **Memory Management** | Minimal resource footprint | Resource efficiency principles |
| **Performance Optimization** | Built-in HTTP module efficiency | Core performance concepts |

**Future Migration Path:**
Should the tutorial application require microservices architecture, the migration would follow these principles:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Current Monolith] --> B[Identify Service Boundaries]
    B --> C[Extract Hello Service]
    C --> D[Add API Gateway]
    D --> E[Implement Service Discovery]
    E --> F[Add Monitoring]
    
    G[Educational Benefits] --> H[Gradual Complexity Introduction]
    H --> I[Microservices Learning Path]
```

### 6.1.6 Architecture Decision Record

**Decision: Monolithic Architecture for Tutorial Application**

| Decision Factor | Rationale | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope Alignment** | Single endpoint with static response | Eliminates unnecessary complexity |
| **Learning Objectives** | Focus on HTTP fundamentals | Clear educational progression |
| **Resource Efficiency** | Node.js employs a "Single Threaded Event Loop" design. The JavaScript event-based model and the JavaScript callback mechanism are employed in the Node.js Processing Model | Optimal resource utilization |
| **Development Speed** | Immediate functionality without infrastructure setup | Faster learning iteration |

**Conclusion:**
The Node.js tutorial application's core services architecture is intentionally simplified to a monolithic design that serves the educational objectives while demonstrating fundamental web server concepts. Building microservices with Node.js is fairly easy, especially with the NestJS framework. The starting point is to create a new NestJS application using their CLI, but such complexity is not warranted for this tutorial's scope and learning objectives.

This architectural decision prioritizes educational clarity, resource efficiency, and development simplicity over distributed system capabilities that would be appropriate for production applications with multiple business domains and scaling requirements.

Based on my analysis of the Node.js tutorial application requirements and the search results, I can now provide the DATABASE DESIGN section for the Technical Specifications document.

## 6.2 DATABASE DESIGN

**Database Design is not applicable to this system.**

### 6.2.1 System Architecture Rationale

The Node.js tutorial application implementing a single '/hello' endpoint that returns "Hello world" operates as a **stateless HTTP server** without any database or persistent storage requirements. The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server that provides two objects: a request (an http.IncomingMessage object) and a response (an http.ServerResponse object). Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.

### 6.2.2 Technical Implementation Characteristics

**Static Response Architecture:**
The application serves static content exclusively, eliminating the need for data persistence mechanisms. The current state of Node.js is such that almost everything we need for the static file server is provided by built-in APIs and a few lines of code. The server generates responses using in-memory processing without requiring external data storage.

**Stateless Operation Model:**
When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back. This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency.

### 6.2.3 Data Flow Architecture

The application follows a **request-response cycle** that operates entirely in memory:

```mermaid

    A[HTTP Client Request] --> B[Node.js HTTP Server]
    B --> C[Request Processing]
    C --> D[Static Response Generation]
    D --> E[HTTP Response Delivery]

    I -.-> J[No Schema Requirements]
    
    K[In-Memory Processing Only] --> L[Static Content Delivery]
    L --> M[Immediate Response Generation]
```

### 6.2.4 Educational Design Philosophy

**Learning-Focused Architecture:**
The tutorial application intentionally excludes database complexity to maintain educational clarity. In reality you will almost never run any http server in this manner however, it might be very helpful to understand what frameworks like Expressjs do under the hood. It also could serve as a very simple testing tool in your local environment.

**Fundamental Concept Demonstration:**
A NodeJS web server is a server built using NodeJS to handle HTTP requests and responses. Unlike traditional web servers like Apache or Nginx, which are primarily designed to give static content, NodeJS web servers can handle both static and dynamic content while supporting real-time communication.

### 6.2.5 Alternative Storage Considerations

**When Database Integration Would Be Required:**
Future extensions of this tutorial application would necessitate database design under the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Database Requirement | Implementation Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **User Management** | User authentication and session storage | Create a crude app for creating and logging in users. To safely store passwords, you want to create a random salt for each new user and use crypto to encrypt the password. |
| **Dynamic Content** | Content management and retrieval | If you want to deliver personalized content you have to store the data somewhere. Let's take a simple example: user signup. |
| **Production Deployment** | Scalable data persistence | SQL databases offer a more rigid and organized data storage and management approach, making them easier to query and analyze. They have been around for decades and have a track record of proven reliability and scalability. |

### 6.2.6 Technology Stack Implications

**Built-in Module Sufficiency:**
Adding the capability to connect databases to Express apps is just a matter of loading an appropriate Node.js driver for the database in your app. This document briefly explains how to add and use some of the most popular Node.js modules for database systems. However, the current tutorial scope requires no such integration.

**Memory-Based State Management:**
The application maintains all operational state in memory during request processing, with no persistent data requirements:

| State Type | Storage Method | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| **Request Data** | HTTP Request Object | Single request cycle |
| **Response Content** | Static string literals | Application runtime |
| **Server Configuration** | Environment variables | Process lifetime |

### 6.2.7 Performance and Scalability Context

**No Database Performance Considerations:**
The absence of database operations eliminates common performance bottlenecks:

- **No Query Optimization**: No SQL query performance tuning required
- **No Connection Pooling**: No database connection management overhead
- **No Data Caching**: No cache invalidation or consistency concerns
- **No Transaction Management**: No ACID compliance requirements

**Educational Performance Benefits:**
Non-Blocking I/O: While the server is processing a request (like querying a database or reading from a file), it does not block other incoming requests. This is handled asynchronously through callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax. The tutorial application demonstrates these concepts without database complexity.

### 6.2.8 Future Database Integration Pathway

**Potential Database Technologies:**
Should the tutorial application evolve to require data persistence, the following technologies would be appropriate:

| Database Type | Use Case | Node.js Integration |
|---|---|---|
| **MySQL** | Node.js can be used in database applications. One of the most popular databases is MySQL. | mysql npm module |
| **PostgreSQL** | Set up a Node.js application with a PostgreSQL database. First, we have to create the PostgreSQL database we are going to use in our Node.js application. | pg npm module |
| **MongoDB** | NoSQL document storage | mongoose npm module |

**Migration Considerations:**
Object-relational mapping (ORM) libraries make it easy to work with databases in JavaScript. They help you define models and relationships between them and handle the SQL operations needed to work with the data.

### 6.2.9 Conclusion

The Node.js tutorial application's database design is **intentionally absent** to maintain focus on fundamental HTTP server concepts. This architectural decision aligns with educational objectives by eliminating data persistence complexity while demonstrating core Node.js capabilities. The stateless, memory-based approach provides immediate functionality without the overhead of database configuration, schema design, or data management concerns that would obscure the primary learning objectives of HTTP request-response cycle understanding.

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

**Integration Architecture is not applicable for this system.**

### 6.3.1 System Architecture Rationale

The Node.js tutorial application implementing a single '/hello' endpoint that returns "Hello world" operates as a **self-contained, standalone HTTP server** without any external system integrations or third-party service dependencies. In order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, the Node.js HTTP API is very low-level. It deals with stream handling and message parsing only.

### 6.3.2 Technical Implementation Characteristics

**Isolated Server Architecture:**
The application utilizes only Node.js built-in modules, specifically the HTTP module, which can be imported via require('node:http') (CommonJS) or import * as http from 'node:http' (ES module). This design approach eliminates the need for external API integrations, message processing systems, or third-party service connections.

**Educational Design Philosophy:**
Creating a server with Node without using any external modules (like Express, Hapi, or Sails.js) is actually quite easy to do! The tutorial application intentionally excludes integration complexity to maintain educational clarity and focus on fundamental HTTP server concepts. The current state of Node.js is such that almost everything we need for the static file server is provided by built-in APIs and a few lines of code.

### 6.3.3 No External Dependencies Architecture

**Zero Integration Requirements:**
The system operates without requiring any of the following integration components:

| Integration Type | Not Required | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| **External APIs** | No third-party API calls | Static response generation only |
| **Message Queues** | No asynchronous messaging | Synchronous request-response cycle |
| **Databases** | No data persistence | In-memory processing only |
| **Authentication Services** | No user management | Open endpoint access |

**Self-Contained Processing Model:**
The HTTP protocol is used for handling transmission of data on the Web (ie client/server model). This means that information exchange between the client and server is half-duplex. Since the HTTP protocol is half-duplex, it can only allow one way information exchange. For example, if a web client makes a request to the server, the server cannot send back a response until that request is received and "completed".

### 6.3.4 System Boundary Definition

**Internal Processing Only:**
The application's system boundary encompasses only the HTTP request-response cycle within the Node.js runtime environment:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[HTTP Client Request] --> B[Node.js HTTP Server]
    B --> C[Request Processing]
    C --> D[Static Response Generation]
    D --> E[HTTP Response Delivery]
    E --> F[Client Receives Response]
    
    G[System Boundary] -.-> B
    G -.-> C
    G -.-> D
    
    H[No External Systems] -.-> I[No API Calls]
    H -.-> J[No Database Queries]
    H -.-> K[No Message Processing]
    H -.-> L[No Third-Party Services]
```

### 6.3.5 Network Communication Patterns

**Direct HTTP Communication:**
The only network communication occurs through standard HTTP protocol between the client and server, without intermediary systems or external service calls:

| Communication Layer | Implementation | External Integration |
|---|---|---|
| **Application Layer** | HTTP request/response | None |
| **Transport Layer** | TCP socket communication | Operating system only |
| **Network Layer** | IP packet routing | Local network stack |

### 6.3.6 Future Integration Considerations

**Potential Integration Scenarios:**
While the current tutorial application requires no integration architecture, future extensions might warrant integration capabilities:

| Extension Scenario | Integration Requirements | Implementation Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Multi-Endpoint API** | RESTful API design patterns | The same foundation will be used to integrate third-party features, most of which likewise use REST APIs, making such integration faster. |
| **Database Connectivity** | Data persistence integration | You can use any database mechanism supported by Node (Express does not define any database-related behavior). |
| **External API Consumption** | Third-party service integration | Use fetch method with async/await keyword in a function. |

### 6.3.7 Educational Value of No Integration

**Learning Progression Benefits:**
The absence of integration architecture serves specific educational purposes:

- **Fundamental Understanding**: Focus on core HTTP server mechanics without external complexity
- **Incremental Learning**: Establishes foundation before introducing integration concepts
- **Debugging Simplicity**: Eliminates external system variables during troubleshooting
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal system requirements for tutorial execution

### 6.3.8 Production Integration Pathway

**Migration to Integrated Architecture:**
Should the tutorial application evolve to require external integrations, the following progression would be appropriate:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Current Standalone Server] --> B[Add Database Integration]
    B --> C[Implement External APIs]
    C --> D[Add Message Processing]
    D --> E[Implement Authentication]
    E --> F[Full Integration Architecture]
    
    G[Educational Progression] --> H[Complexity Introduction]
    H --> I[Integration Patterns]
    I --> J[Production Readiness]
```

### 6.3.9 Conclusion

The Node.js tutorial application's integration architecture is **intentionally absent** to maintain focus on fundamental HTTP server concepts without the complexity overhead of external system integrations. This architectural decision aligns with educational objectives by providing a clear, self-contained learning environment that demonstrates core Node.js capabilities. If you read this far, you should have a solid understanding of setting up a basic HTTP server with Node.js. Now go forth and build cool stuff with Node!

The standalone design eliminates integration concerns such as API authentication, message processing, external service contracts, and third-party dependencies, allowing learners to concentrate on mastering HTTP request-response cycles, routing logic, and response generation within the Node.js runtime environment. Future evolution toward production applications would naturally introduce integration architecture components as business requirements expand beyond the tutorial's educational scope.

## 6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

**Detailed Security Architecture is not applicable for this system.**

### 6.4.1 Security Architecture Rationale

The Node.js tutorial application implementing a single '/hello' endpoint that returns "Hello world" operates as a **basic educational HTTP server** without complex security requirements beyond standard development practices. HTTP requests are received by the Node.js HTTP server and handed over to the application code via the registered request handler. The server does not parse the content of the request body. Therefore any DoS caused by the contents of the body after they are handed over to the request handler is not a vulnerability in Node.js itself, since it's the responsibility of the application code to handle it correctly.

### 6.4.2 Standard Security Practices Implementation

**Basic HTTP Security Headers:**
The tutorial application will implement fundamental security practices appropriate for educational and development environments. There are some security-related HTTP headers that your site should set. These headers are: Strict-Transport-Security enforces secure (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections to the server ... X-Content-Type-Options prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type

**Security Implementation Strategy:**

| Security Practice | Implementation | Educational Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Input Validation** | Basic URL path validation | Understanding request sanitization |
| **Error Handling** | Generic error messages | Preventing information disclosure |
| **HTTP Headers** | Standard security headers | Learning security fundamentals |

### 6.4.3 Development Environment Security

**Local Development Security Measures:**
The application implements security practices suitable for tutorial and development environments:

**Basic Security Controls:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[HTTP Request] --> B[Input Validation]
    B --> C{Valid Request?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Process Request]
    C -->|No| E[Return Generic Error]
    
    D --> F[Generate Response]
    F --> G[Set Security Headers]
    G --> H[Send Response]
    
    E --> I[Log Error Details]
    I --> J[Return 404/400 Status]
    
    K[Security Headers] --> L[X-Content-Type-Options]
    K --> M[X-Frame-Options]
    K --> N[X-XSS-Protection]
```

### 6.4.4 Security Best Practices for Tutorial Context

**Educational Security Implementation:**
Don't send error details to clients: Avoid exposing detailed error messages to clients, as they can reveal sensitive information about your application's structure and vulnerabilities. Instead, log detailed errors on the server side and send generic error messages to clients.

**Security Practices Table:**

| Security Aspect | Tutorial Implementation | Production Consideration |
|---|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Not required for static endpoint | OAuth 2.0, JWT implementation |
| **Authorization** | Open access for educational use | Role-based access control |
| **Data Protection** | No sensitive data handling | Encryption and key management |

### 6.4.5 Node.js Runtime Security

**Runtime Environment Security:**
Using a Long Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js provides added security as critical bug fixes, security updates, and performance improvements are available longer. The tutorial application utilizes Node.js 22.x LTS for enhanced security baseline.

**Runtime Security Measures:**

| Security Control | Implementation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js Version** | LTS 22.x with security updates | Latest security patches |
| **Environment Variables** | NODE_ENV configuration | Proper error handling |
| **Dependency Management** | Zero external dependencies | Reduced attack surface |

### 6.4.6 HTTP Protocol Security

**Basic HTTP Security Implementation:**
Correctly configure the server timeouts, so that connections that are idle or where requests are arriving too slowly can be dropped. See the different timeouts in http.Server, particularly headersTimeout, requestTimeout, timeout, and keepAliveTimeout.

**HTTP Security Configuration:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as HTTP Client
    participant Server as Node.js Server
    participant Security as Security Layer
    
    Client->>Server: HTTP Request
    Server->>Security: Validate Request
    Security->>Security: Check Headers
    Security->>Security: Validate URL Path
    
    alt Valid Request
        Security->>Server: Process Request
        Server->>Security: Generate Response
        Security->>Security: Set Security Headers
        Security->>Client: Secure Response
    else Invalid Request
        Security->>Security: Log Security Event
        Security->>Client: Generic Error Response
    end
```

### 6.4.7 Error Handling Security

**Secure Error Management:**
For example, if you're using the Express web application and don't start your Node.js servers with NODE_ENV=production then you might be leaking sensitive information to the client. This is because the default error handling middleware in Express will expose stack traces and other sensitive information to the client when errors are left unhandled and uncaught. This is because the default NODE_ENV is development and not production.

**Error Handling Security Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Error Detected] --> B{Error Type}
    B -->|Client Error| C[Log Basic Info]
    B -->|Server Error| D[Log Detailed Info]
    B -->|Security Event| E[Log Security Details]
    
    C --> F[Return Generic 400]
    D --> G[Return Generic 500]
    E --> H[Return Generic Error]
    
    F --> I[No Stack Trace Exposure]
    G --> I
    H --> I
    
    I --> J[Client Receives Safe Error]
```

### 6.4.8 Input Validation Security

**Basic Input Sanitization:**
In order to avoid these attacks, input to your application should be sanitized first. The best input validation technique is to use a list of accepted inputs. However, if this is not possible, input should be first checked against expected input scheme and dangerous inputs should be escaped.

**Input Validation Implementation:**

| Input Type | Validation Method | Security Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| **URL Path** | Exact string matching | Prevents path traversal |
| **HTTP Method** | Whitelist validation | Limits attack vectors |
| **Request Headers** | Basic format checking | Prevents header injection |

### 6.4.9 Logging and Monitoring Security

**Security Event Logging:**
Logging application activity is an encouraged good practice. It makes it easier to debug any errors encountered during application runtime. It is also useful for security concerns, since it can be used during incident response.

**Security Monitoring Strategy:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Security Events] --> B[Console Logging]
    B --> C[Request Monitoring]
    C --> D[Error Tracking]
    D --> E[Security Analysis]
    
    F[Log Categories] --> G[Access Attempts]
    F --> H[Error Events]
    F --> I[Performance Issues]
    
    G --> J[Educational Debugging]
    H --> J
    I --> J
```

### 6.4.10 Future Security Considerations

**Production Security Evolution:**
When the tutorial application evolves toward production use, comprehensive security architecture would include:

| Security Domain | Production Requirements | Implementation Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Multi-factor authentication, OAuth 2.0 | Enables mandatory two-factor authentication to access sensitive data and services. Enable more than a basic authentication - choose standard authentication methods like OAuth, OpenID, etc. |
| **Data Protection** | HTTPS, encryption at rest | In production, always use HTTPS: HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the client and server, protecting it from interception and tampering. Always use HTTPS in production to ensure data integrity and confidentiality, especially for sensitive information like login credentials and personal data. |
| **Rate Limiting** | DoS protection, request throttling | Limiting concurrent requests helps prevent Nodejs applications from being unresponsive due to overwhelming requests at the same time. By using a middleware or balancer, you can limit the number of requests. Ngnix is a widely used service for load balancing; however, you can also make use of middleware express-rate-limiter or rate-limiter-flexible package. |

### 6.4.11 Security Architecture Conclusion

The Node.js tutorial application's security architecture is **intentionally simplified** to focus on educational objectives while implementing fundamental security practices. New security releases to be made available Tuesday, July 15, 2025 ensures the Node.js runtime maintains current security standards.

The application demonstrates basic security concepts including input validation, error handling, and secure HTTP headers without the complexity of production security frameworks. This approach provides a foundation for understanding security principles that can be expanded as applications evolve toward production deployment with comprehensive authentication, authorization, and data protection requirements.

**Security Decision Summary:**
- **No Authentication Framework**: Static endpoint requires no user management
- **Basic Input Validation**: URL path sanitization for routing security
- **Standard HTTP Headers**: Fundamental security headers for development
- **Generic Error Handling**: Information disclosure prevention
- **Educational Security Focus**: Learning-oriented security implementation

This security architecture serves the tutorial's educational purpose while establishing security awareness that scales to production applications requiring comprehensive security frameworks and advanced threat protection mechanisms.

## 6.5 MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY

**Detailed Monitoring Architecture is not applicable for this system.**

### 6.5.1 System Architecture Rationale

The Node.js tutorial application implementing a single '/hello' endpoint that returns "Hello world" operates as a **basic educational HTTP server** without complex monitoring infrastructure requirements. Node.js performance monitoring is the collection of Node.js performance data and measuring its metrics to meet the desired service delivery. It involves keeping track of the applications' availability, monitoring logs and metrics and reporting their imminent dysfunction.

However, the tutorial application's scope and educational objectives do not warrant comprehensive monitoring architecture typically required for production systems. Monitoring is a game of finding out issues before customers do â obviously this should be assigned unprecedented importance. For this tutorial application, basic monitoring practices provide sufficient observability while maintaining educational clarity.

### 6.5.2 Basic Monitoring Practices Implementation

**Console-Based Logging Strategy:**
The tutorial application implements fundamental monitoring practices appropriate for educational and development environments. Logging helps capture real-time events, errors, and other important information from the application, while monitoring involves tracking application performance metrics over time. Together, they provide critical insights into application health, enabling proactive issue resolution.

**Educational Monitoring Approach:**

| Monitoring Aspect | Implementation | Educational Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Request Logging** | Console output for HTTP requests | Understanding request flow |
| **Error Tracking** | Console error messages | Debugging skill development |
| **Server Health** | Startup/shutdown notifications | Operational awareness |

### 6.5.3 Basic Health Checks Implementation

**Simple Health Check Strategy:**
We will implement a basic Node.js health check. Before we jump into how to implement health check in Node.js, let's talk about its importance and why you should get into the habit of performing these checks.

**Health Check Components:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[HTTP Request to /hello] --> B[Server Response Check]
    B --> C{Response Status}
    C -->|200 OK| D[Healthy Status]
    C -->|Error| E[Unhealthy Status]
    
    F[Server Startup] --> G[Port Binding Check]
    G --> H{Port Available?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Server Ready]
    H -->|No| J[Server Error]
    
    K[Basic Metrics] --> L[Response Time]
    K --> M[Request Count]
    K --> N[Error Rate]
    
    D --> O[Log Success Event]
    E --> P[Log Error Event]
    I --> Q[Log Server Ready]
    J --> R[Log Server Error]
```

### 6.5.4 Console Logging Implementation

**Development-Focused Logging:**
In Node.js, the basic console.log and console.info will log to stdout. Console.warn and console.error will log to stderr. By default, these will print the output to your console.

**Logging Strategy Table:**

| Log Level | Purpose | Implementation | Output Stream |
|---|---|---|---|
| **INFO** | Request processing events | console.log() | stdout |
| **WARN** | Non-critical issues | console.warn() | stderr |
| **ERROR** | Application errors | console.error() | stderr |

**Basic Logging Implementation:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as HTTP Client
    participant Server as Node.js Server
    participant Logger as Console Logger
    
    Client->>Server: HTTP GET /hello
    Server->>Logger: Log request received
    Server->>Server: Process request
    
    alt Successful Processing
        Server->>Logger: Log success (INFO)
        Server->>Client: 200 OK Response
    else Error Processing
        Server->>Logger: Log error (ERROR)
        Server->>Client: Error Response
    end
    
    Logger->>Logger: Output to console
```

### 6.5.5 Performance Monitoring Basics

**Simple Performance Tracking:**
Here are some of the things we checked for: the response time of the server, the uptime of the server, the status code of the server (as long as it is 200, we are going to get an "OK" message), and the timestamp of the server.

**Basic Performance Metrics:**

| Metric | Measurement Method | Educational Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Response Time** | Request timestamp tracking | Understanding latency concepts |
| **Server Uptime** | Process start time calculation | Availability awareness |
| **Request Count** | Simple counter increment | Traffic pattern recognition |

### 6.5.6 Error Handling and Monitoring

**Basic Error Monitoring:**
We want to log exceptions so we know when our application has an error. Not all exceptions are caused by bugs in our code. For example, there might be trouble with a network connection. Our code can handle this kind of exception because we are expecting it.

**Error Monitoring Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Error Detected] --> B{Error Type}
    B -->|Request Error| C[Log Client Error]
    B -->|Server Error| D[Log Server Error]
    B -->|Network Error| E[Log Network Error]
    
    C --> F[Console.warn Output]
    D --> G[Console.error Output]
    E --> H[Console.error Output]
    
    F --> I[Continue Processing]
    G --> J[Error Recovery]
    H --> J
    
    I --> K[Monitor Error Rate]
    J --> K
    K --> L[Educational Analysis]
```

### 6.5.7 Basic Alerting Strategy

**Development Environment Alerting:**
For the tutorial application, alerting consists of immediate console feedback and basic error notifications suitable for development environments.

**Alert Implementation:**

| Alert Type | Trigger Condition | Response Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Server Start** | Successful port binding | Console success message |
| **Server Error** | Port binding failure | Console error message + exit |
| **Request Error** | Invalid request processing | Console warning message |

### 6.5.8 Monitoring Tools Consideration

**Future Monitoring Evolution:**
While the tutorial application uses basic console logging, To achieve efficient Node.js performance monitoring, you must follow certain best practices. The following effective methods have been implemented from time to time and recognized as Node.js performance monitoring best practices: Knowing what needs to be monitored in a Node.js application is crucial to your success. This allows you to trace and track the right metrics and collect necessary information on the performance of your NodeJS application.

**Monitoring Tools Progression:**

```mermaid

    F --> G[Production Tools]
    G --> H[Enterprise Solutions]
    
    A -.-> E
    B -.-> F
    C -.-> G
    D -.-> H
```

### 6.5.9 Observability Best Practices for Tutorial Context

**Educational Observability Implementation:**
Health checks provide a sanity check when trouble occurs. If you have on-call duty and something breaks (e.g. an instance is down), checking the healthiness of the services is the first and easiest thing to do without digging into actual code. Therefore, even the most basic health check provides some value.

**Basic Observability Components:**

| Component | Implementation | Learning Objective |
|---|---|---|
| **Logging** | Console-based output | Understanding log levels and purposes |
| **Health Checks** | Simple endpoint status | Basic availability monitoring |
| **Metrics** | Request counting | Performance measurement concepts |

### 6.5.10 Monitoring Implementation Guidelines

    N --> O[Educational Debugging]
```

### 6.5.11 Conclusion

The Node.js tutorial application's monitoring and observability approach is **intentionally simplified** to focus on educational objectives while demonstrating fundamental monitoring concepts. Monitoring Node.js applications effectively is no longer optionalâit's essential for ensuring performance, reliability, and a smooth user experience. With a range of observability and APM tools available, choosing the right one for your stack and team can be challenging. Whether you're tracking memory leaks, CPU spikes, or asynchronous bottlenecks, the right observability stack can save you hours of debugging and protect your user experience.

The basic monitoring implementation provides:
- **Console-based logging** for immediate feedback and debugging
- **Simple health checks** through endpoint availability
- **Basic performance metrics** for educational analysis
- **Error tracking** for development troubleshooting

This approach establishes monitoring awareness and practices that scale to production applications requiring comprehensive APM solutions, distributed tracing, and advanced observability platforms. The tutorial's monitoring strategy prioritizes learning fundamental concepts over production-grade monitoring infrastructure complexity.

## 6.6 TESTING STRATEGY

**Detailed Testing Strategy is not applicable for this system.**

### 6.6.1 System Architecture Rationale

The Node.js tutorial application implementing a single '/hello' endpoint that returns "Hello world" operates as a **basic educational HTTP server** without complex testing infrastructure requirements. Node.js now includes a full-featured test runner that covers most testing needs without any external dependencies. However, the tutorial application's scope and educational objectives warrant a simplified testing approach that demonstrates fundamental testing concepts without overwhelming complexity.

**Educational Testing Philosophy:**
This can be achieved by selectively cherry-picking techniques, tools and test targets that are cost-effective and provide great ROI. Test only as much as needed, strive to keep it nimble, sometimes it's even worth dropping some tests and trade reliability for agility and simplicity.

### 6.6.2 TESTING APPROACH

### 6.6.1 Unit Testing

**Testing Framework Selection:**
Node.js now includes a full-featured test runner that covers most testing needs without any external dependencies. The tutorial application will utilize the Node.js built-in test runner for its simplicity and zero-dependency approach.

**Testing Framework and Tools:**

| Component | Selection | Version | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| **Test Runner** | Node.js Built-in Test Runner | Native (Node.js 22.x) | All this changed when Node.js released an experimental built-in test runner in Node.js version 18 and made the test runner stable in Node.js version 20. |
| **Assertion Library** | Node.js Built-in Assert | Native (Node.js 22.x) | The methods from node:assert and snapshot testing functions are available by default. |
| **Module System** | ES Modules | Native | The built-in test runner provides a clean, familiar API that feels modern and complete |

**Test Organization Structure:**

âââ package.json
```

**Mocking Strategy:**
Testing using Node.js enables the use of mocks, stubs, and spies that are important for testing individual components in isolation from the entire software. The tutorial application will implement basic mocking for HTTP request/response objects without external mocking libraries.

**Code Coverage Requirements:**

| Coverage Type | Target | Measurement Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Line Coverage** | 90%+ | The Node.js test runner includes an experimental feature for tracking code coverage, which is enabled using the --experimental-test-coverage flag. |
| **Function Coverage** | 100% | Built-in coverage reporting |
| **Branch Coverage** | 85%+ | Conditional logic testing |

**Test Naming Conventions:**
- Test files: `*.test.mjs` pattern
- Test descriptions: Descriptive behavior-driven naming
- Test functions: `test('should return hello world for /hello endpoint', ...)`

**Test Data Management:**
Static test data embedded in test files for simplicity, avoiding external test data files or complex test data generation.

### 6.6.2 Integration Testing

**Service Integration Test Approach:**
The tutorial application's integration testing focuses on HTTP request-response cycle validation rather than complex service integration.

**API Testing Strategy:**

| Test Category | Implementation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **HTTP Endpoint Testing** | Direct HTTP requests to server | Validate request-response cycle |
| **Route Integration** | URL path and method validation | Ensure routing logic works correctly |
| **Response Format Testing** | Content-Type and status code validation | Verify HTTP compliance |

**Database Integration Testing:**
Not applicable - the tutorial application operates without database dependencies.

**External Service Mocking:**
Not applicable - the tutorial application has no external service dependencies.

**Test Environment Management:**
Each file that the test runner discovers is then executed in a separate child process. Tests will run in isolated processes with dedicated port allocation to prevent conflicts.

### 6.6.3 End-to-End Testing

**E2E Test Scenarios:**
The tutorial application's E2E testing covers complete HTTP request-response workflows:

| Scenario | Test Description | Expected Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **Happy Path** | GET request to /hello endpoint | 200 status with "Hello world" response |
| **Error Path** | GET request to undefined endpoint | 404 status with error message |
| **Server Lifecycle** | Server startup and shutdown | Proper port binding and cleanup |

**UI Automation Approach:**
Not applicable - the tutorial application provides HTTP API responses without user interface components.

**Test Data Setup/Teardown:**
Minimal setup/teardown focusing on server lifecycle management:
- **Setup**: Start HTTP server on available port
- **Teardown**: Close server connections and cleanup resources

**Performance Testing Requirements:**

| Performance Metric | Target | Test Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Response Time** | < 50ms for /hello endpoint | Request timing measurement |
| **Server Startup** | < 1 second | Process timing validation |
| **Memory Usage** | < 50MB during operation | Resource monitoring |

**Cross-browser Testing Strategy:**
Not applicable - the tutorial application provides HTTP API responses testable with any HTTP client.

### 6.6.10 CONCLUSION

The Node.js tutorial application's testing strategy is **intentionally simplified** to focus on educational objectives while demonstrating fundamental testing concepts. The intent behind the Node.js test runner is to provide a limited set of testing functionality that can be used to test projects without requiring a third-party dependency.

The testing approach provides:
- **Built-in Test Runner** for zero-dependency testing
- **Basic Unit Testing** for core functionality validation
- **Simple Integration Testing** for HTTP request-response cycles
- **Educational Test Patterns** for learning fundamental concepts
- **Minimal Complexity** appropriate for tutorial scope

This testing strategy establishes testing awareness and practices that scale to production applications requiring comprehensive testing frameworks, advanced mocking capabilities, and complex test automation pipelines. The tutorial's testing approach prioritizes learning fundamental concepts over production-grade testing infrastructure complexity.

**Testing Decision Summary:**
- **Node.js Built-in Test Runner**: Zero external dependencies for educational clarity
- **Basic Coverage Requirements**: Sufficient for tutorial validation without complexity
- **Simple Test Patterns**: Educational demonstration of testing concepts
- **Minimal Infrastructure**: Focus on testing fundamentals over tooling complexity
- **Educational Focus**: Learning-oriented testing implementation

Based on my analysis of the Node.js tutorial application requirements and the search results, I can now provide the USER INTERFACE DESIGN section for the Technical Specifications document.

# 7. USER INTERFACE DESIGN

**No user interface required.**

## 7.1 SYSTEM INTERFACE RATIONALE

### 7.1.1 HTTP API-Only Architecture

The Node.js tutorial application implementing a single '/hello' endpoint that returns "Hello world" operates as a **pure HTTP API server** without any graphical user interface components. The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server that provides two objects: a request (an http.IncomingMessage object) and a response (an http.ServerResponse object). Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.

### 7.1.2 Educational Design Philosophy

**Command-Line and HTTP Client Interaction:**
The tutorial application is designed for educational purposes where interaction occurs through HTTP clients rather than traditional web interfaces. A web server receives HTTP requests from a client, like your browser, and provides an HTTP response, like an HTML page or JSON from an API. Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript to write back-end code, even though traditionally it was used in the browser to write front-end code. Having both the frontend and backend together like this reduces the effort it takes to make a web server.

### 7.1.3 Interface Interaction Methods

**Primary Interaction Channels:**

| Interface Type | Implementation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **HTTP Client Interface** | Browser, curl, Postman | Testing and validation of server responses |
| **Command Line Interface** | Terminal/console | Server startup, monitoring, and control |
| **Development Tools** | Text editors, IDEs | Code development and debugging |

### 7.1.4 Response Format Specification

**HTTP Response Interface:**
The application delivers responses through standard HTTP protocol without HTML rendering or client-side JavaScript execution:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 11
Connection: keep-alive

Hello world
```

### 7.1.5 Client Interaction Examples

**Browser-Based Testing:**
Users can interact with the server through web browsers by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/hello` to receive the plain text response. Navigate to the URL http://localhost:3000/. If everything is working, the browser should display the string "Hello World!". Navigate to the URL http://127.0.0.1:3000. If everything is working, the browser should display the string "Hello World".

**Command-Line Testing:**
```bash
# Using curl to test the endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/hello

#### Expected response
Hello world
```

### 7.1.6 No Frontend Framework Requirements

**Backend-Only Implementation:**
This software generally falls into two categories: frontend and backend. Front-end code is concerned with how the content is presented, such as the color of a navigation bar and the text styling. Back-end code is concerned with how data is exchanged, processed, and stored. Code that handles network requests from your browser or communicates with the database is primarily managed by back-end code.

The tutorial application focuses exclusively on backend server implementation without frontend presentation layers, eliminating the need for:

- HTML templates or rendering engines
- CSS styling frameworks
- JavaScript client-side libraries
- User interface components
- Interactive elements or forms
- Session management interfaces
- Authentication screens

### 7.1.7 Educational Value of No-UI Design

**Learning Focus Benefits:**
The absence of user interface complexity allows learners to concentrate on fundamental HTTP server concepts:

- **HTTP Protocol Understanding**: Direct exposure to request-response cycles
- **Server-Side Logic**: Focus on backend processing without frontend distractions
- **API Development Concepts**: Understanding of service-oriented architecture
- **Testing Methodologies**: Learning to validate server functionality through HTTP clients

### 7.1.8 Future UI Considerations

**Potential Interface Extensions:**
While the current tutorial scope excludes user interface requirements, future educational extensions might include:

| Extension Type | UI Requirements | Implementation Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Web Dashboard** | HTML interface for server monitoring | We can serve HTML as strings in Node.js to the user, but it's preferable that we load HTML files and serve their content. This way, as the HTML file grows we don't have to maintain long strings in our Node.js code, keeping it more concise and allowing us to work on each aspect of our website independently. This "separation of concerns" is common in many web development setups. |
| **API Documentation** | Interactive API explorer | Swagger/OpenAPI integration |
| **Multi-Endpoint Tutorial** | RESTful API interface | To create a web server with Express initialize an app with express(), defining routes with app.get(), and sending responses using res.send(). |

### 7.1.9 Testing Interface Requirements

**Development and Validation Interfaces:**
The tutorial application requires testing interfaces that do not constitute traditional user interfaces:

**Testing Tools Integration:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[HTTP Server] --> B[HTTP Client Testing]
    B --> C[Browser Testing]
    B --> D[Command Line Tools]
    B --> E[API Testing Tools]
    
    F[Development Interface] --> G[Code Editor]
    F --> H[Terminal/Console]
    F --> I[Debugging Tools]
    
    J[No GUI Components] -.-> K[No HTML Forms]
    J -.-> L[No CSS Styling]
    J -.-> M[No JavaScript Frontend]
```

### 7.1.10 Conclusion

The Node.js tutorial application's user interface design is **intentionally absent** to maintain focus on fundamental HTTP server concepts without the complexity overhead of frontend development. In order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, the Node.js HTTP API is very low-level. It deals with stream handling and message parsing only. It parses a message into headers and body but it does not parse the actual headers or the body.

This design decision aligns with educational objectives by providing a clear, backend-focused learning environment that demonstrates core Node.js server capabilities through direct HTTP protocol interaction. The application serves as a foundation for understanding server-side development concepts before introducing the additional complexity of user interface frameworks and frontend integration patterns.

**Interface Decision Summary:**
- **No Graphical User Interface**: Pure HTTP API server implementation
- **HTTP Client Interaction**: Testing through browsers, curl, and API tools
- **Command-Line Management**: Server control through terminal interface
- **Educational Focus**: Backend concepts without frontend complexity
- **Future Extensibility**: Foundation for UI integration in advanced tutorials

# 8. INFRASTRUCTURE

**Detailed Infrastructure Architecture is not applicable for this system.**

## 8.1 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE RATIONALE

### 8.1.1 Standalone Application Characteristics

The Node.js tutorial application implementing a single '/hello' endpoint that returns "Hello world" operates as a **standalone educational application** without complex deployment infrastructure requirements. Node.jsÂ® is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts.

The tutorial application's scope and educational objectives do not warrant comprehensive infrastructure architecture typically required for production systems. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking, making it ideally suited for simple, self-contained applications.

### 8.1.2 Educational Design Philosophy

**Learning-Focused Architecture:**
The tutorial application intentionally excludes infrastructure complexity to maintain educational clarity and focus on fundamental HTTP server concepts. The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server that demonstrates core concepts without deployment overhead.

**Minimal Resource Requirements:**
To run a basic Node.js application, a server with a 512MB memory and a 500MB storage is generally sufficient. A 500 MHz CPU is also a reasonable minimum. However, for more complex applications, you might need more RAM and CPU, potentially 1 GB of memory or more.

### 8.1.3 Infrastructure Decision Matrix

| Infrastructure Aspect | Tutorial Application | Production Application |
|---|---|---|
| **Deployment Complexity** | Direct Node.js execution | Container orchestration, CI/CD pipelines |
| **Resource Requirements** | Minimal (512MB RAM, 500MB storage) | Scalable infrastructure with load balancing |
| **Environment Management** | Local development only | Multi-environment (dev/staging/prod) |
| **Monitoring Requirements** | Console logging | Comprehensive APM and monitoring |

## 8.2 MINIMAL BUILD AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

### 8.2.1 Build System Requirements

**Zero Build Process Architecture:**
The tutorial application requires no complex build pipeline or compilation steps. Node.js now includes a full-featured test runner that covers most testing needs without any external dependencies.

**Build Requirements Table:**

| Build Component | Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Source Code** | Single JavaScript file (server.mjs) | ES Module with built-in HTTP module |
| **Dependencies** | Zero external dependencies | Node.js built-in modules only |
| **Build Tools** | None required | Direct execution with `node server.mjs` |
| **Compilation** | Not applicable | Interpreted JavaScript execution |

### 8.2.2 Distribution Strategy

**Simple Distribution Methods:**
The tutorial application supports multiple distribution approaches suitable for educational purposes:

#### Direct Source Distribution

| Distribution Method | Implementation | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **Source Code Sharing** | Single .mjs file distribution | Educational tutorials and code examples |
| **Version Control** | Git repository with minimal structure | Collaborative learning and version tracking |
| **Package Distribution** | npm package for educational use | Reusable tutorial components |

#### Single Executable Distribution

You can now bundle your Node.js application into a single executable file, simplifying deployment and distribution: # Create a self-contained executable node --experimental-sea-config sea-config.json

**Single Executable Application (SEA) Configuration:**

```json
{
  "main": "server.mjs",
  "output": "hello-server.blob",
  "disableExperimentalSEAWarning": true
}
```

**SEA Benefits for Tutorial Distribution:**
- Complete Self-Containment: Code, dependencies, assets, and runtime bundled in one binary Â· Environment Independence: The application carries its environment with it
- Node.js supports the creation of single executable applications by allowing the injection of a blob prepared by Node.js, which can contain a bundled script, into the node binary.

### 8.2.3 Runtime Environment Requirements

**Node.js Runtime Specifications:**

| Runtime Component | Specification | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js Version** | 22.x LTS (Active until October 2025) | Plan for Distribution: Single executable applications and modern packaging make deployment simpler |
| **Module System** | ES Modules (ESM) | ES Modules (ESM) have become the clear winner, offering better tooling support and alignment with web standards |
| **Memory Requirements** | 50MB minimum, 512MB recommended | Lightweight application footprint |
| **Storage Requirements** | 100MB for Node.js runtime + application | Minimal storage footprint |

# APPENDICES

## A.1 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS REFERENCE

### A.1.1 Node.js HTTP Module Technical Details

**HTTP Module Core Specifications:**
This module, containing both a client and server, can be imported via require('node:http') (CommonJS) or import * as http from 'node:http' (ES module). In order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, the Node.js HTTP API is very low-level. It deals with stream handling and message parsing only. It parses a message into headers and body but it does not parse the actual headers or the body.

**HTTP Message Header Handling:**
HTTP message headers are represented by an object like this: { "content-length": "123", "content-type": "text/plain", "connection": "keep-alive", "host": "example.com", "accept": "*/*" } Keys are lowercased. Values are not modified.

**Stream Processing Architecture:**
The HTTP interfaces in Node.js are designed to support many features of the protocol which have been traditionally difficult to use. In particular, large, possibly chunk-encoded, messages. The interface is careful to never buffer entire requests or responses, so the user is able to stream data.

### A.1.2 ES Modules Implementation Standards

**ES Module Syntax and Import Patterns:**
The specifier of an import statement is the string after the from keyword, e.g. 'node:path' in import { sep } from 'node:path'. Relative specifiers like './startup.js' or '../config.mjs'. They refer to a path relative to the location of the importing file. The file extension is always necessary for these.

**Module System Configuration:**
Node.js will treat the following as ES modules when passed to node as the initial input, or when referenced by import statements or import() expressions: Files with an .mjs extension. Files with a .js extension when the nearest parent package.json file contains a top-level "type" field with a value of "module". Within a package, the package.json "type" field defines how Node.js should interpret .js files. A package.json "type" value of "module" tells Node.js to interpret .js files within that package as using ES module syntax.

**ES Module Advantages:**
ESM gained stable support in Node.js 14 and is now the preferred choice for modern JavaScript development. ES modules, or ECMAScript modules, are the official and standardized way to work with modules in JavaScript. They address the limitations of earlier module systems and offer a more streamlined, performant, and future-proof approach to organizing and sharing code. Browser compatibility: ES modules are supported directly by modern web browsers without the need for additional tools or bundling. Asynchronous loading: ES modules support asynchronous loading, meaning they can be fetched and processed in parallel without blocking the main thread.

### A.1.3 Node.js Performance Characteristics

**Node.js 22 Performance Improvements:**
With the release of Node.js v22, improvements to WebStreams have helped Fetch jump from 2,246 requests per second to 2,689 requests per second, marking a good enhancement for an API known to be performance-sensitive. With the release of Node.js v22, improvements to WebStreams have helped Fetch jump from 2,246 requests per second to 2,689 requests per second, marking a good enhancement for an API known to be performance-sensitive.

**Buffer Performance Enhancements:**
Node.js Buffers have become significantly faster in all its APIs -- except when handling base64 data. Buffer.byteLength â Shows a 67% of performance improvement when compared to v20.17.0. For buffer.compare(buff) specifically, performance has increased by over 200%, marking a substantial improvement.

### A.1.4 HTTP Security Enhancements

**Strict Mode HTTP Parsing:**
Node.js 2024 has made a change to be more careful with the web data it deals with. Now, when it uses the llhttp library to understand HTTP messages (which are basically how computers talk over the web), it uses something called strict mode by default. This means if Node.js sees any weird or incorrect web data, it will stop and throw an error instead of trying to fix it or ignore it. First, it stops bad actors from sending weird data on purpose to mess with or crash your serverâa common attack called a denial-of-service (DOS) attack. Second, it keeps things clear and straightforward because your server won't get confused by odd messages it can't understand.

**Security Release Information:**
Updates are now available for the 22.x, 20.x, 18.x Node.js release lines for the following issues. Node.js fetch will be upgraded to undici v6.19.2 on Node.js 18.x and Node.js 20.x. Node.js 22.x already includes undici v6.19.2.

### A.1.5 HTTP Status Code Standards

**Standard HTTP Status Codes:**
An invalid HTTP status code has been specified. Status codes must be an integer between 100 and 599 (inclusive).

**Common HTTP Status Codes:**
The server cannot find the requested resource. The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist.

**Node.js HTTP Status Code Access:**
$ node > http.STATUS_CODES { '100': 'Continue', '101': 'Switching Protocols', '102': 'Processing', '200': 'OK', '201': 'Created', '202': 'Accepted', '203': 'Non-Authoritative Information', '204': 'No Content', '205': 'Reset Content', '206': 'Partial Content', '207': 'Multi-Status', '300': 'Multiple Choices', '301': 'Moved Permanently', '302': 'Moved Temporarily', '303': 'See Other', '304': 'Not Modified', '305': 'Use Proxy', '307': 'Temporary Redirect', '400': 'Bad Request', '401': 'Unauthorized', '402': 'Payment Required', '403': 'Forbidden', '404': 'Not Found', '405': 'Method Not Allowed', '406': 'Not Acceptable', '407': 'Proxy Authentication Required', '408': 'Request Time-out', '409': 'Conflict', '410': 'Gone', '411': 'Length Required', '412': 'Precondition Failed', '413': 'Request Entity Too Large', '414': 'Request-URI Too Large', '415': 'Unsupported Media Type', '416': 'Requested Range Not Satisfiable', '417': 'Expectation Failed', '418': 'I\'m a teapot', '422': 'Unprocessable En
