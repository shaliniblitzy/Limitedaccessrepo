/**
 * Handles HTTP GET requests to the '/hello' endpoint in the Node.js tutorial HTTP server.
 * This handler processes incoming requests, ensures protocol compliance, and sends a static
 * 'Hello world' response using the centralized HTTP utility.
 * 
 * The handler implements comprehensive logging for observability and educational clarity,
 * tracking both request receipt and response generation events. It delegates response
 * generation to the centralized HTTP utility for maintainability and consistency.
 * 
 * Design Principles:
 * - Educational clarity: Simple, well-documented implementation for learning purposes
 * - Protocol compliance: Proper HTTP response handling and status codes
 * - Observability: Comprehensive logging for request/response traceability
 * - Maintainability: Centralized response generation through utility functions
 * - Error resilience: Graceful handling of potential runtime issues
