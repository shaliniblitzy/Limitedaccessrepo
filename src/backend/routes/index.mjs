// Import the main router function that dispatches HTTP requests to the correct handler

/**
 * Routes Index Module for Node.js Tutorial HTTP Server
 * 
 * This module serves as the central aggregation point for all route-related functionality
 * in the Node.js tutorial application. It provides a single import point for the main
 * router and establishes a pattern for future route module organization as the application
 * scales beyond the current single-endpoint tutorial scope.
 * 
 * Educational Purpose:
 * This index pattern demonstrates modular architecture principles by centralizing route
 * exports and creating a clear separation between route definition (router.mjs) and route
 * aggregation (index.mjs). This approach supports maintainability, discoverability, and
 * extensibility as applications grow in complexity.
 * 
 * Architecture Pattern:
 * - Single Import Point: Provides consolidated access to all routing functionality
 * - Modular Organization: Separates routing logic from route aggregation
 * - Educational Clarity: Simple, well-documented structure for learning purposes
 * - Scalability Foundation: Establishes pattern for future route module additions
 * 
 * Design Principles:
 * - Zero Logic Implementation: Contains no routing logic, purely aggregation
 * - Educational Documentation: Comprehensive comments for learning purposes
 * - Maintainability Focus: Clear module boundaries and export patterns
 * - Discoverability: Single point of truth for route module imports
 * - Extensibility: Ready to accommodate additional route modules as needed
 * 
 * Usage Pattern:
 * The server entry point imports routing functionality from this index:
 * ```javascript
 * import { router } from './routes/index.mjs';
 * ```
 * 
 * This pattern allows the server to remain unchanged even as route organization
 * evolves, providing stable import paths and consistent architecture patterns.
 * 
 * Future Extensibility:
 * As the tutorial application grows, this index can accommodate additional exports:
 * ```javascript
 * export { router } from './router.mjs';
 * export { middleware } from './middleware.mjs';
 * export { validators } from './validators.mjs';
 * ```
 * 
 * System Architecture Integration:
 * This module integrates with the overall system architecture by:
 * - Supporting the event-driven HTTP server design
 * - Maintaining zero external dependencies philosophy
 * - Providing educational clarity through documentation
 * - Enabling modular component organization
 * 
 * Performance Considerations:
 * - No runtime overhead: Simple re-export with no processing logic
 * - Minimal memory footprint: No additional state or configuration
 * - Fast module loading: Direct export pass-through without transformation
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - No additional attack surface: Pure aggregation with no logic
 * - Clear module boundaries: Explicit export control and visibility
 * - Educational transparency: Well-documented export intentions

// Re-export the main router function as a named export
// This provides the primary routing functionality for the HTTP server
// The router handles all HTTP request routing decisions, including:
// - URL path parsing and normalization
// - HTTP method validation and dispatch
// - Route matching against defined endpoints
// - Error handling for undefined routes (404) and unsupported methods (405)
// - Comprehensive request/response logging for observability
// - Protocol compliance with HTTP/1.1 standards
export { router };

/**
 * Route Module Organization:
 * 
 * Current Structure:
 * routes/
 * ├── index.mjs          (This file - Route aggregation)
 * ├── router.mjs         (Main routing logic and dispatch)
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * router.mjs depends on:
 * ├── handlers/helloHandler.mjs    (GET /hello endpoint handler)
 * ├── handlers/errorHandler.mjs    (404 and 405 error handlers)
 * ├── utils/logger.mjs             (Structured logging utilities)
 * 
 * Export Summary:
 * - router: Function that processes HTTP requests and dispatches to handlers
 * 
 * Future Module Additions:
 * This index is designed to accommodate additional route modules:
 * - Route validators for input sanitization
 * - Route middleware for cross-cutting concerns
 * - Route utilities for common routing operations
 * - Route configuration for dynamic route management
 * 
 * Educational Value:
 * This modular organization teaches:
 * - Separation of concerns between routing logic and aggregation
 * - Clear module boundaries and export patterns
 * - Scalable architecture patterns for growing applications
 * - Maintainable code organization through centralized exports
 * - Professional development practices for team environments
